Act: read ModuleeadingList.md, and enhance the first unmarked item

## Working Protocol

1. Select the first unmarked single checklist item to work on.
2. Enhance comments per the patterns and length guidance above.
3. Mark the item as completed in the checklist.
4. Commit and clear the context and proceed to the next item until all are completed.

## Module Reading List

This file lists each module file under `Sources` with pointers for deeper reading.

## Comment Enhancement Plan

Goal: Enhance comments across all Swift files in `Sources` using clear, consistent, English documentation [[All comments in English]] and pragmatic depth.

- Patterns to apply (use Swift doc comments):
  - Jazzy compatibility:
    - Use Swift-Markdown doc comments that Jazzy parses: prefer `///` for single symbols and `/** ... */` for multi-line summaries.
    - Structure with standard sections that Jazzy recognizes, such as `- Parameters:`, `- Returns:`, `- Throws:`, `- Note:`, and `- Warning:`.
    - Use Markdown features that render well in Jazzy: short lists, code fences with language specifiers (such as ```swift), and inline code via backticks.
    - Keep lines wrapped around ~100 characters to avoid awkward wrapping in generated docs.
    - Link related symbols or references using Markdown links where helpful.
  - File header: High-level purpose, core responsibilities, and key types/functions summary.
    - Format: `///` or `/** ... */`
    - Length: 3–6 lines (wrap at ~100 chars).
  - Public API (types, initializers, methods, properties):
    - Use `///` with: one-line summary; Parameters (name + purpose); Returns; Throws; Thread-safety and main invariants; Complexity when relevant.
    - Length: 3–10 lines per symbol.
  - Complex private logic / algorithms / state machines:
    - Use brief block above code explaining intent and non-obvious constraints, such as invariants, preconditions, postconditions, and why choices were made.
    - Length: 2–6 lines; avoid restating code.
  - Concurrency and lifecycle:
    - Note execution context (main thread vs background), reentrancy, cancellation, and ownership.
  - Error handling and retries:
    - Clarify error types, retry/backoff strategy, and failure-mode expectations.
  - Performance notes:
    - Mention time/space complexity and hotspots where applicable.
  - Do not:
    - Restate trivial code, add noisy inline comments, or leave TODOs—implement instead.
  - Language and tone:
    - Write in English, concise and informative; use examples such as short scenario bullets when helpful.
