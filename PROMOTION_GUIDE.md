🚀 Introducing Monstra - A high-performance Swift framework that solves the most common iOS development challenges!

🧵 Thread (1/6)

✨ Key Features:
• Execution Merging - No more duplicate API calls
• TTL Caching - Smart memory management  
• Retry Logic - Bulletproof error handling
• Cross-platform - iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS

#Swift #iOS #OpenSource

(2/6) 💡 Problem: Your app makes the same API call 10 times simultaneously

❌ Without Monstra: 10 network requests
✅ With Monstra: 1 network request, 9 get cached result

MonoTask automatically merges concurrent executions!

(3/6) 🏎️ Performance matters! 

MemoryCache with:
• TTL expiration
• Priority-based eviction  
• Avalanche protection
• Real-time statistics

Perfect for image caching, API responses, computed values

(4/6) 🔄 Robust retry strategies:
• Exponential backoff
• Fixed intervals  
• Hybrid approaches
• Custom retry logic

Never lose data due to temporary network issues!

(5/6) 📦 Easy integration:

Swift Package Manager:
.package(url: "https://github.com/yangchenlarkin/Monstra.git", from: "1.0.0")

CocoaPods:
pod 'Monstra'

### LinkedIn Post:
```
🚀 Just open-sourced Monstra - a high-performance Swift framework solving common mobile development challenges!

After years of building iOS apps, I noticed developers repeatedly implementing the same patterns:
• Preventing duplicate API calls
• Managing memory caches
• Handling network retries
• Coordinating async tasks

Monstra provides battle-tested solutions for all of these.

Key innovations:
✅ Execution Merging - Automatically deduplicates concurrent requests
✅ Intelligent Caching - TTL with avalanche protection  
✅ Advanced Retry Logic - Exponential backoff and custom strategies
✅ Cross-platform - Works on iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS

Perfect for:
• API clients that need reliability
• Apps with heavy caching requirements  
• Background task coordination
• Performance-critical applications

The framework is fully documented with comprehensive examples and has 99%+ test coverage.

Title: "Monstra - High-performance Swift framework for task execution and caching"

Hey r/swift! 👋

I've been working on Monstra, an open-source Swift framework that tackles some common iOS development pain points:

🎯 **What it solves:**
- Duplicate API calls when multiple screens need the same data
- Memory cache management with TTL and priority eviction
- Robust retry logic for network operations  
- Coordinating heavy background tasks

🚀 **Key Features:**
- **Execution Merging**: Multiple concurrent requests → single execution
- **Smart Caching**: TTL + priority + avalanche protection
- **Retry Strategies**: Exponential backoff, fixed intervals, custom logic
- **Cross-platform**: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS support

📦 **Easy Integration:**
Available via Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods

🔗 **Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/yangchenlarkin/Monstra
- Documentation: https://yangchenlarkin.github.io/Monstra/
- Examples: Comprehensive real-world usage examples included

The codebase has 99%+ test coverage and follows Swift best practices. I'd love to get feedback from the community!
