💡 Problem: Your app makes the same API call 10 times simultaneously

❌ Without Monstra: 10 network requests
✅ With Monstra: 1 network request, 9 get cached result

MonoTask automatically merges concurrent executions!

🔥 MonoTask in action:

```swift
let task = MonoTask<UserProfile> { callback in
    // API call happens only once, even with 100 concurrent calls
    APIClient.fetchUser { result in
        callback(result)
    }

### **Technical Deep Dive Post:**
```
🧠 Deep dive: How Monstra's Execution Merging works

Problem: Multiple UI components request the same data simultaneously, causing redundant network calls and poor performance.

Traditional approach:
```
Component A → API Call 1 → Response 1
Component B → API Call 2 → Response 2  
Component C → API Call 3 → Response 3
```

Monstra's MonoTask approach:
```
Component A ┐
Component B ├→ Single API Call → Shared Response → All components
Component C ┘
```

This pattern reduces:
• Network bandwidth by up to 90%
• Server load significantly  
• Battery usage on mobile devices
• UI inconsistencies from race conditions

The implementation uses Swift's advanced concurrency features and careful memory management to ensure thread safety without sacrificing performance.

Title: "Monstra - High-performance Swift framework for task execution and caching"

Hey r/swift! 👋

I've been working on Monstra, an open-source Swift framework that tackles some common iOS development pain points:

🎯 **What it solves:**
- Duplicate API calls when multiple screens need the same data
- Memory cache management with TTL and priority eviction  
- Robust retry logic for network operations
- Coordinating heavy background tasks

🚀 **Key Features:**
- **Execution Merging**: Multiple concurrent requests → single execution
- **Smart Caching**: TTL + priority + avalanche protection
- **Retry Strategies**: Exponential backoff, fixed intervals, custom logic
- **Cross-platform**: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS support

📦 **Easy Integration:**
Available via Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods

```swift
// Example: API call happens only once, even with multiple concurrent requests
let task = MonoTask<UserData> { callback in
    APIService.fetchUser { result in
        callback(result)
    }
}

// All of these share the same execution
task.execute { data in /* handle result */ }
task.execute { data in /* handle result */ }  
task.execute { data in /* handle result */ }
```

🔗 **Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/yangchenlarkin/Monstra
- Documentation: https://yangchenlarkin.github.io/Monstra/
- Examples: Comprehensive real-world usage examples included

The codebase has 99%+ test coverage and follows Swift best practices. I'd love to get feedback from the community!

### **r/iOSProgramming Post:**

Title: "Open-sourced a Swift framework for common iOS development challenges"

Fellow iOS developers! 📱

Just released Monstra - a framework I've been building to solve recurring problems I see in iOS apps:

**Common scenarios it handles:**
1. **Multiple screens loading the same user profile** → Single API call, shared result
2. **Image caching with memory pressure** → Smart eviction with TTL and priority  
3. **Network requests failing intermittently** → Automatic retry with exponential backoff
4. **Background tasks interfering with each other** → Coordinated execution with limits

**Real-world example:**
Your app's home screen, profile screen, and settings screen all need user data. Instead of 3 API calls:

```swift
let userTask = MonoTask<User> { callback in
    APIClient.fetchCurrentUser(completion: callback)
}

// All screens get the same data from one API call
homeScreen.loadUser(with: userTask)
profileScreen.loadUser(with: userTask)  
settingsScreen.loadUser(with: userTask)
```

**Why I built this:**
After code reviews across multiple companies, I kept seeing the same patterns implemented differently (and sometimes incorrectly). This framework provides battle-tested implementations.

**Features:**
- Zero dependencies
- 99%+ test coverage
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Works on iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS

Would love feedback from the community! What similar patterns do you find yourself reimplementing across projects?

Title: "Monstra – High-performance Swift framework for task execution and caching"

Monstra is an open-source Swift framework that addresses common mobile development challenges through three main components:

1. **MonoTask**: Merges concurrent executions of the same task, preventing duplicate API calls and improving performance
2. **MemoryCache**: TTL-based caching with priority eviction and avalanche protection  
3. **Task Managers**: Coordinated execution of lightweight and heavy background operations

The framework emerged from observing repeated patterns across iOS codebases - developers frequently reimplement execution merging, cache management, and retry logic with varying degrees of correctness and performance.

Key technical features:
- Execution merging reduces redundant network calls by up to 90%
- Memory cache with configurable TTL, priority-based eviction, and statistics
- Advanced retry strategies (exponential backoff, fixed intervals, custom logic)
- Thread-safe implementation using semaphores and dispatch queues
- Cross-platform support (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS)

The codebase maintains 99%+ test coverage and includes comprehensive documentation with real-world examples.

Title: "Announcing Monstra: Framework for task execution and caching patterns"

Hello Swift community!

I'd like to share Monstra, an open-source framework addressing common patterns in iOS/macOS development:

**Background:**
Through code reviews and consulting work, I've noticed developers frequently reimplement similar patterns for:
- Preventing duplicate API calls from multiple UI components
- Managing memory caches with proper eviction strategies  
- Implementing robust retry logic for network operations
- Coordinating background task execution

**Solution:**
Monstra provides battle-tested implementations of these patterns with a focus on:
- Performance (execution merging, efficient caching)
- Reliability (comprehensive error handling, retry strategies)  
- Developer experience (clear APIs, extensive documentation)
- Production readiness (99%+ test coverage, thread safety)

**Architecture highlights:**
- Uses Swift's modern concurrency features appropriately
- Minimal dependencies (Foundation only)
- Modular design allowing selective adoption
- Comprehensive test suite including performance and concurrency tests

The framework is available via Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods, with full documentation and examples.

I'd appreciate feedback from the community, particularly around:
- API design decisions
- Performance characteristics
- Additional patterns that might benefit from standardization
