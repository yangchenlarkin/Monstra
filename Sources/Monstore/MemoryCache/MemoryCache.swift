//  This file is intended to provide the main interface and implementation for an in-memory cache system in the Monstore module.
//  It may serve as a base or entry point for various cache strategies (e.g., LRU, TTL, priority-based).
//  If empty, it acts as a placeholder for future cache-related logic and type definitions.
