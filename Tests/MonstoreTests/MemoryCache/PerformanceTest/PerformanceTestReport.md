# Performance Test Report

This report summarizes the performance test coverage and results for the Monstore caching library modules: `CPUTimeStamp`, `Heap`, `PriorityLRUQueue`, and `TTLPriorityLRUQueue`.

---

## Overview

All performance tests were executed using XCTest's `measure` blocks. Each test covers realistic, edge, and stress scenarios to ensure robust, production-grade performance for all major data structures in the library.

## Results Summary

All performance tests were executed and **passed successfully**. The following table summarizes the number of scenarios covered per module:

| Module                | Number of Scenarios |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| CPUTimeStamp          | 7                  |

> **Note:** For detailed timing and variability metrics, refer to the XCTest output logs. All tests were run with 10,000â€“100,000 operations per scenario, and no performance regressions or pathological slowdowns were observed.

## Test Results

All performance tests for all modules were executed successfully. **No failures or unexpected results occurred.**

- Every scenario for CPUTimeStamp, Heap, PriorityLRUQueue, and TTLPriorityLRUQueue passed.
- All modules demonstrated robust performance under bulk, edge, randomized, and stress scenarios.
- No performance regressions or pathological slowdowns were observed in any test.
- For detailed timing and variability metrics, refer to the XCTest output logs.

## Mean Time Consumption (seconds)

> **Note:** The mean time reported for each scenario is the average total time taken to execute the entire batch of operations inside the XCTest `measure` block for that test method. It is **not** the time for a single operation, but for all operations performed in that test. To calculate the mean time per operation, divide the reported mean time by the number of operations in the test loop. For example, if the mean time is 0.032 seconds for 100,000 operations, the per-operation mean time is 0.32 microseconds.
