## 6. Additional Notes
- All tests run in local Mac environment, results for reference only.
- Detailed raw data can be obtained by running `swift test`.
- Large-scale tests verify the correctness of time complexity.
- For more detailed comparisons or larger-scale tests, test case parameters can be adjusted.
